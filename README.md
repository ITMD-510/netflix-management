Video on Demand platforms are in a really competitive market and have to deal with millions of active users every day. Each of them watches different shows and pays for the type of account (premium, regular, family plan...) that best suits their needs. Since these platforms implement complex algorithms to recommend shows to the users that they are most likely to watch, it is important to keep track of the liked/disliked shows and have a well organized database for this algorithms to perform their best. This project will create correlations among each user, account type, most watched shows, liked and disliked shows, recent searched titles, monthly payment, and so on. That way, the algorithms can perform queries to access the information about each user in an automated way and improve their overall user experience so that they don't leave this platform.
